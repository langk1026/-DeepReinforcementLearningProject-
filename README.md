# -DeepReinforcementLearningProject(Competition)-
This Deep Reinforcement Learning Project was prepared by 1) Lang Kah Chun 2) Yee Qing Wei 3) Sun Qi Yang. The objective of this report is to train a smart agent to play Atari Breakout-V5 game and conduct a comparative analysis of different algorithm used in DeepRL.

Alongside, we have succesfully implemented Rainbow algorithm refering to https://github.com/Kaixhin/Rainbow and use the trained agent to compete in class competition for Atari Pong game.
